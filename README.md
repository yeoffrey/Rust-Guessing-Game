# My Rust Guessing Game

## Setup
```
git clone git@github.com:yeoffrey/Rust-Guessing-Game.git
cd Rust-Guessing-Game
cargo run
```

## Reflection
This was an easy project that I basically copied from [this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) example and then made my own modifications.

## Additional Features
1. User can set the range for the number they have to guess.
2. The program will count the number of tries the user takes and then show them the number.

## Future Work
1. Better error handling.
2. Better validation for input, specifically when the user sets the range for the numbers.
3. Test for negative inputs.
